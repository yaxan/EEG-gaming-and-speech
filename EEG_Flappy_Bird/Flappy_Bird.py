Modified version of flappy bird from: https://github.com/clear-code-projects/FlappyBird_Python
Credits to https://github.com/ryanlopezzzz/EEG for guidance on how to use EEG data as inputs

This game takes in EEG waves as input, the more relaxed (eyes closed), the more the bird goes up. In essence, blinking makes the bird jump.
Game parameters can be changed to make the game easier or harder, and the values in CUTOFF should be adjusted to the player's preference.

Currently, first run through the bird flies high off the map and requires a reset (space-bar) because there is no data at the start. I may or may not get around to fixing it.
